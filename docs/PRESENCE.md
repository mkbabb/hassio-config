# Presence Detection

Room-level occupancy detection with a 4-state DFA, dynamic cooldown, sensor aggregation, and data-driven area configuration.

## State Machine

```
         motion detected
    OFF ──────────────────> ON
     ▲                       │
     │                       │ all sensors clear
     │ delay expires         ▼
     └──────────────── PENDING_OFF ──motion──> ON
                             │
                         (cooldown)

    UNKNOWN: all sensors unavailable
```

**Critical rule**: `PENDING_OFF` is treated as `OFF` for re-triggering. If motion fires during cooldown, it cancels the pending turn-off and transitions back to `ON`.

## Cooldown Formula

```
coolDown(ms) = min(MAX_COOL_DOWN, baseCoolDown + min(dwellMinutes, 60) × 10) × 1000
```

- Base: 10 minutes (600s)
- Maximum: 20 minutes (1200s)
- Longer occupancy = longer hysteresis (linear ramp, capped at 60min dwell)
- Examples: 5min dwell → base + 50s, 30min → base + 300s, 60min+ → base + 600s

## Presence Areas (9 rooms)

| Area | Sensors | Controlled Entities | Cooldown |
|------|---------|---------------------|----------|
| bonus_room | 2 motion | — | 600s |
| downstairs_bathroom | 2 motion | light.downstairs_bathroom_light | 600s |
| garage | 4 (door+motion+obstruction) | — | 600s |
| guest_bathroom | 1 motion | — | 600s |
| guest_bedroom | 1 motion | — | 600s |
| laundry_room | 3 motion | light.laundry_room_light | 600s |
| master_bathroom | 3 motion | — | 600s |
| plant_room | 2 motion | — | 600s |
| upstairs_hall | 2 motion | light.upstairs_hallway_lights, light.flower_lamp | 600s |

Areas are defined in `seed-registry.ts` and stored in `global.get("presenceRegistry")`.

## Sensor Aggregation

- **Any non-stale sensor = "on"** → presence state = ON
- **All sensors = "unknown"** → UNKNOWN
- **All sensors off/mixed/stale** → OFF

### Stale Sensor Detection

A PIR sensor reporting "on" with no state change for >60 minutes is treated as stuck at the hardware/protocol level (real PIR cycles every 30-120s). Staleness filtering is layered:

1. **`presence.ts`** — on any incoming sensor event, stale "on" sensors are mapped to "off" before aggregation. Catches stuck sensors immediately when another sensor in the area fires.
2. **`cooldown-ticker.ts`** — on the 15s periodic sweep, `anyLiveLevelSensorOn` excludes stale sensors. If all "on" sensors are stale, the sweep transitions the DFA to "off" and fires turn_off actions immediately (no dwell requirement). Logged via `node.warn()` with entity ID, elapsed minutes, and topic.

Helper: `isSensorStale(entityId, thresholdMs?)` in `utils.ts`. Computes elapsed time from the entity's `last_changed` timestamp in the global HA state cache (not `timeSinceChangedMs`, which is only populated on event payloads).

## Pathological Sequence Detection

The DFA tracks 3 state levels (`state`, `prevState`, `prevPrevState`) to detect the ON→UNKNOWN→OFF pattern — typically caused by a sensor going unavailable briefly. When detected, the turn-off action is suppressed.

## Flow Context (per room)

Stored as `flow.get("flowInfo.{topic}")` within the Presence Subflow instance:

```typescript
{
  state: "on" | "off" | "pending_off" | "unknown",
  prevState: string,
  prevPrevState: string,
  lastOn: number,           // timestamp ms
  lastOff: number,
  delay: number,            // current cooldown ms
  coolDownEndTime: number   // absolute expiry
}
```

Per-room state is stored in global context as `global.get("presenceFlowInfo.{topic}")` and `global.get("presenceStates.{topic}")`, making it accessible from API endpoints on any tab.

## REST API

| Method | Path | Handler |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/presence/` | list-areas.ts — All areas with runtime state |
| GET | `/presence/:topic/status` | area-status.ts — Full flow state for one area |
| POST | `/presence/` | configure-area.ts — Create/update area config |
| POST | `/presence/:topic/clear-cooldown` | clear-cooldown.ts — Reset cooldown for one area |
| POST | `/presence/clear-all-cooldowns` | clear-all-cooldowns.ts — Reset all active cooldowns |

## Published Sensors

| Sensor | State | Key Attributes |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| `sensor.presence_{topic}_state` | on/off/pending_off/unknown | dwell_minutes, cooldown_remaining_min, sensors_on |
| `sensor.presence_{topic}_cooldown` | float (minutes remaining) | end_time, total_seconds |

Published by `publish-presence-state.ts` after each DFA transition and by `cooldown-ticker.ts` every 15s for active cooldowns.

## Namespace Blacklist

Presence-tracked entities are registered in the `"presence"` namespace of the static-states blacklist system (`seed-registry.ts`). This means:

- **Schedule engine** skips them (already calls `shouldFilterEntity()`)
- **Cache-states** excludes them from home restoration (away still turns them off)
- **Scene rollback** excludes them from captures

This eliminates the need for the old 10-node reset hack on the Presence tab.

## Node-RED Flow Structure

**Presence Subflow** (`173c5faccfb73051`) — 10 instances (one per room):
```
state-changed → debounce → presence.ts → trigger (cooldown delay) → get-flow-info → service call
                                │                                            │
                                └─ publish-presence-state                    └─ influx-logger
```

**Presence 🔦 tab** (`f5468ca00e94e761`):
- Inject → seed-registry (runs once on deploy)
- 3 http-in/function/http-response chains for REST API
- 10-node reset chain (deprecated, scheduled for removal)

## InfluxDB Measurements

- `presence_events` — state transitions, timing, sensor states (tags: topic, room, event_type)
- `get_flow_info_events` — cooldown checks at trigger execution
